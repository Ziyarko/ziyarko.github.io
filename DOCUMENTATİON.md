# Project 1: Creating a Github Website
For my first project, I was tasked with creating a GitHub website, i had zero ideo on how to create a github website.
Initially, I thought the page would be built using the README file and with just typing the websie down and adding links.
This did not work as the website looked pale and ugly during the preview and only showed the code of the websites when i opeened them from my links. 
I realized I needed to use HTML links for the websites to open normally and also form the websie usng a html format.
To help with the process, I asked ChatGPT for templates and learned how to modify the code to suit my needs.
By understanding and adjusting the templates, I was able to successfully create my GitHub page and learned how to navigate GitHubâ€™s interface.

# Proje 2: Connect4
For my second project i was tasked with creating a Connect4 game on scratch. 
I didnt know where to start this project so i searched up a youtube tutorial.
I started on the basics, inserting the sprites, putting them in position, adding some movement.
I added a few variables to keep in track of whose turn it is, the board coordinates, column no, if the game has ended, etc.
After finishing the basic connect four game i saw that everyone had done the game from the same tutorial video andthat all the games looked identical. I decided to add some uniqueness to it and added the game a boxing theme. I coded my own start screen and my own ending screen
and created some animations to make the game for fun and unique.
