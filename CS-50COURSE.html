        <p>Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ziya, this is my page for my CS-50 Course</p>

        <h2>College board 1.1 - 1.3 Notes</h2>

        <h3>Collaboration:</h3>
        <p>At the Facebook headquarters there is an open area with places to sit, and people get together and collaborate to try to come up with innovations.</p>
        <p>In Super Mario Brothers 2, Kensuke Tanabe, while designing the game, wanted to do vertical levels where the player goes upwards. While collaborating with Shigeru Miyamoto, Miyamoto suggested they do horizontal levels as well, and that is why Super Mario Brothers 2 has horizontal and vertical levels, adding more diversity to the gameplay of the game, boosting its ratings and creating a great game.</p>
        <p>The skills learned through collaboration are: Communication, Consensus Building, Conflict resolution.</p>

        <h3>How to Collaborate in AP CSP</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pair programming:</strong> Pair programming is when one person writes the code while the other reviews it and gives another perspective.</li>
            <li><strong>Think-pair-share:</strong> Students think through a problem alone, then pair with a partner and share their ideas. This results in more diverse answers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Program Function and Purpose</h3>
        <h4>Computing Innovations</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Applications/Physical Devices/Systems</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Guiding Questions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Why does the computing innovation exist?</li>
            <li>What problem does the innovation solve?</li>
            <li>What does the computing innovation allow us to do that we could not do before?</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Social Media apps:</strong> Allows users to connect from a distance and archive their activities.</li>
            <li><strong>E-commerce:</strong> Allows users to shop from wherever they want.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Identify Inputs to a Program</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CRD-2.C.1:</strong> Program inputs are data sent to a computer for processing by a program. Input can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text.</li>
            <li><strong>CRD-2.C.2:</strong> An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program.</li>
            <li><strong>CRD-2.C.3:</strong> Events can be generated when a key is pressed, a mouse is clicked, a program is started, or any other defined action occurs that affects the flow of execution.</li>
            <li><strong>CRD-2.C.4:</strong> Inputs usually affect the output produced by a program.</li>
            <li><strong>CRD-2.C.5:</strong> In event-driven programming, program statements are executed when triggered rather than through the sequential flow of control.</li>
            <li><strong>CRD-2.C.6:</strong> Input can come from a user or other programs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Program Outputs</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CRD-2.D.1:</strong> Program outputs are any data sent from a program to a device. Program output can come in a variety of forms, such as tactile, audio, visual, or text.</li>
            <li><strong>CRD-2.D.2:</strong> Program output is usually based on a program's input or prior state (e.g., internal values).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Computer Programs Accept Input in a Variety of Forms:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Tactile (touch)</li>
            <li>Audio</li>
            <li>Visual</li>
            <li>Text (including numerical values)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What Types of Input Do Your Devices Accept?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Smartphone/tablet</li>
            <li>Laptop computer</li>
            <li>Gaming console</li>
        </ul>
